# Hive-Projects
Collation repository for the school projects I've done during my time at Hive Helsinki. Some smaller projects have been moved directly into libft.

## Index

### Minitalk
> Simple client & server applications that communicate with only a couple unix signals.

### FdF
> 3D wireframe rendering with minilibx.

### Push_swap
> Sort two stacks with limited instructions.
